# CoreEscuela

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project creates lists  of courses, asigments, califications and students, making it so that 

* Every course has a random amount of students 

* Every student has 5 asigments

* Every asigment has a calification (created randomly)

All of this while also telling how many students every course has

# Who is this for?

For anyone who would like to test his knowledge with lists, it is a bit basic but you never know too much about lists.
